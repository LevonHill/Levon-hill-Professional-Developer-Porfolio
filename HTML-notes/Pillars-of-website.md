CTA: RULES

What Makes a CTA?
A CTA is a directive—usually a button, link, or message—that tells users what to do next.
Examples:
"Get Started" – Pushes users toward signing up.

"Hire Me" – A direct portfolio CTA for freelance work.

"Download Now" – Drives conversions for software or files.

"Contact Me" – Encourages outreach for work or questions.

Where to Place CTAs?
Hero Section – The first and strongest CTA (e.g., “Start Your Journey”).

Portfolio/Projects – (e.g., “View Case Study” or “See More Work”).

About Section – (e.g., “Let’s Connect” to lead into a contact form).

Footer – A last-chance CTA (e.g., “Subscribe for Updates”).

CTA Best Practices
Be Clear & Direct – No weak words. No hesitation. Powerful commands only.

Make It Stand Out – Bold colors, big buttons, impossible to ignore.

Use Action Verbs – "Start," "Get," "Build," "Explore," "Join"—these move people.

A website without a CTA is a blade without an edge—pointless. Make them act
